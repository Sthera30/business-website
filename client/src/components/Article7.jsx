                        <h2>Will Web Development Be Replaced by AI? Here's What's Really Happening</h2>

                        <p>Every few months, I see another headline claiming AI is about to make web developers obsolete. As someone who's been building websites for quite some time, I've heard these doomsday predictions before. Remember when website builders like Wix and Squarespace were supposed to kill the web development industry? Yeah, that didn't happen. So let's talk about what's actually going on with AI and web development in 2025.

                    <h2 id="the-tools-that-have-everyone-talking" style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>1. The Tools That Have Everyone Talking</h2>
                    <p>I'll admit it, some of the new AI tools are impressive. We've seen a wave of platforms like Builder.io, Framer AI, and others that can generate decent looking websites from prompts. Type in <b>create a restaurant website with an online booking system</b> and boom, you've got something that looks surprisingly good at first glance.</p>
                    <p>Even traditional platforms like WordPress and Shopify have integrated AI assistants that can help with layout suggestions, content creation, and basic customization. The question on everyone's mind is that, does this mean human web developers are on the way out?</p>


                    <h2 id='what-ai-can-(actually)-do-right-now' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>2. What AI Can (Actually) Do Right Now</h2>
                    <p>Let's be real about what AI can currently handle when it comes to web development:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>Create basic website layouts and designs based on templates</li>
                        <li>Generate placeholder content and suggest copy</li>
                        <li>Handle simple styling changes and responsive adjustments</li>
                        <li>Automate repetitive coding tasks</li>
                        <li>Suggest code completions and fix basic errors</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>These capabilities are genuinely useful, and yes, they're improving rapidly. I've incorporated some of these tools into my own workflow, they're fantastic for speeding up certain aspects of the job.</p>

                    <h2 id='where-ai-falls-flat-(for-now)' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>3. Where AI Falls Flat (For Now)</h2>
                    <p>But here's where things get interesting. Despite all the hype, AI still struggles with:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>Understanding the unique business context and objectives behind a website</li>
                        <li>Creating truly original designs that stand out from the crowd</li>
                        <li>Handling complex integrations between different systems</li>
                        <li>Troubleshooting when multiple issues interact</li>
                        <li>Troubleshooting when multiple issues interact</li>
                        <li>Creating accessible websites that work for all users</li>
                        <li>Developing complex custom functionality beyond templates</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>I recently had a client come to me after trying to use an AI website builder. <b>It looked great in the preview,</b> she told me, <b>but once I tried to integrate it with our booking system and payment processor, everything fell apart.</b></p>


                    <h2 id='the-new-role-of-web-developers' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>4. The New Role of Web Developers</h2>
                    <p>Here's my take. AI isn't replacing web developers, it's changing how we work.</p>
                    <p>The most successful web developers I know are already embracing AI tools to handle the mundane parts of their job. This frees them up to focus on the aspects that truly require human insight:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>Strategic planning and consultation</li>
                        <li>Custom functionality development</li>
                        <li>Performance optimization for specific contexts</li>
                        <li>Accessibility implementation</li>
                        <li>Integration of complex systems</li>
                        <li>User experience research and testing</li>
                        <li>Ongoing support and maintenance</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>In fact, I'm seeing a new breed of  AI enhanced developers who can build solutions faster and at a higher quality than ever before by leveraging these tools appropriately.</p>

                    <h2 id='who-should-be-worried?' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>5. Who Should Be Worried?</h2>
                    <p>I won't sugarcoat it , some parts of the industry will face disruption:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>Developers who only build basic brochure websites might struggle</li>
                        <li>Those who don't adapt to incorporating AI tools may find themselves outpaced</li>
                        <li>Agencies that compete solely on price for template based work</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>But for developers who bring strategic thinking, problem solving, and technical expertise to the table, AI is an opportunity, not a threat.</p>


                    <h2 id="the-human-element-that-can't-be-replaced" style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>6. The Human Element That Can't Be Replaced</h2>
                    <p>Let’s be real, websites aren’t just made of code and pretty designs. They’re built on real stories, real people, and real emotion.</p>
                    <p>The other day, I sat down with a woman from my hometown who runs a small pottery business. Her family’s been doing this for a very long time. As she spoke about wanting a website that truly reflects their journey, she got emotional. We ended up spending two hours talking about her granny’s old techniques, and what makes their work special.</p>
                    <p>No AI prompt box is going to pick up on that emotion. No algorithm is going to understand why the specific shade of blue matters to her brand or why the placement of certain products needs to honor family tradition.</p>
                    <p>Real web development is messy and human. It's about reading the room when a client doesn't like something but is too polite to say it directly. It's understanding cultural context and local meaning that no overseas trained AI could possibly grasp.</p>



                    <h2 id='the-future-is-collaborative' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>7. The Future Is Collaborative</h2>
                    <p>The most likely future isn't one where AI replaces web developers, it's one where web developers who collaborate effectively with AI replace those who don't.</p>
                    <p>I'm already using AI to:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>Generate initial mockups that I then refine</li>
                        <li>Create starter code that I customize</li>
                        <li>Test for bugs and accessibility issues</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>This hybrid approach lets me deliver better results for my clients while focusing my human creativity and problem, solving where it matters most.</p>


                    <h2 id='what-business-owners-should-know' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>8. What Business Owners Should Know</h2>
                    <p>If you're a business owner wondering what this means for your website needs, here's my advice:</p>
                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>Look for developers who embrace AI tools while bringing human expertise</li>
                        <li>Understand that website creation is just the beginning. Maintenance, updates, and optimization are ongoing needs</li>
                        <li>Focus on business outcomes rather than just having a website that looks nice</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>The most successful websites aren't just visually appealing,  they're strategically designed to meet specific business objectives, something AI still struggles to fully understand.</p>


                    <h2 id='the-bottom-line' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>9. The Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>Will AI replace web developers? Not anytime soon. Will it change the industry? Absolutely,it already is.</p>
                    <p>The web developers who thrive will be those who leverage AI as a powerful tool in their arsenal while continuing to provide the strategic thinking, technical expertise, and human understanding that no AI can match.</p>
                    <p>As for me, I'm excited about the possibilities. These new tools are letting me create better websites, more quickly, for clients who might not have been able to afford custom development before. That's not a threat to my business, it's an opportunity to serve more people and create more value.</p>
                    <p>Think about calculators for a second. When they came out in the 70s, people thought it was the end of the road for mathematicians and accountants. But that’s not what happened at all. Instead of becoming useless, those professionals leveled up, they stopped wasting time on boring calculations and started solving bigger, more meaningful problems.</p>
                    <p>It’s the same with AI and web development. We’re not being replaced, we’re being freed up. AI can handle the repetitive stuff so we can focus on the creative, strategic work that actually moves the needle for businesses. That’s not the end of our role. That’s growth.</p>
