                    <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving your website’s visibility on search engines like Google. When done correctly, it helps your ideal customers find you online - especially those searching for <b>web design in South Africa </b>or <b>SEO services in Gqeberha.</b></p>
                    <p>Think of SEO as making your business more "visible" in the online world. It’s not just about getting more traffic - it’s about getting the right traffic. The kind of people actively looking for what your business provides.</p>

                    <h2 id='the-power-of-google-search' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>The Power of Google Search</h2>
                    <p>Here’s a fact: <b>93% of online experiences start with a search engine,</b> according to <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/importance-of-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search Engine Journal.</a> And when people search, they rarely go past the first page of results.</p>
                    <p>That means:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>If your business is on <b>page 1</b>, you're seen as legit and trustworthy.</li>
                        <li>If you're on <b>page 2 or beyond</b>, you're practically invisible.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>If someone in <b>Gqeberha</b> or <b>Uitenhage</b> searches “professional web design near me” or “SEO services South Africa,” will your business appear?</p>
