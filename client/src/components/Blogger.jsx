                        <p>

                            In today’s digital world, having a website isn’t enough. If your business doesn’t show up on Google, you’re basically invisible to your customers. That’s where SEO comes in — the secret weapon that helps your website get found, builds trust with potential clients, and drives real results.

                    <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving your website so it ranks higher on search engines like Google. It’s how people find you online when they’re searching for services or products you offer.</p>
                    <p>Think of SEO as making your business more "visible" in the online world. It’s not just about getting more traffic — it’s about getting the right traffic. The kind of people actively looking for what your business provides.</p>

                    <h2 id='the-power-of-google-search' style={{ fontWeight: 300, marginTop: '4rem' }}>The Power of Google Search</h2>
                    <p>Here’s a fact: <b>93% of online experiences start with a search engine,</b> according to <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/importance-of-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search Engine Journal.</a> And when people search, they rarely go past the first page of results.</p>
                    <p>That means:</p>

                    <ul className='un'>

                        <li>If your business is on <b>page 1</b>, you're seen as legit and trustworthy.</li>
                        <li>If you're on <b>page 2 or beyond</b>, you're practically invisible.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Imagine someone searching for "Best digital agency near me" or "Professional website for my business" — wouldn’t you want your business to pop up first?</p>
